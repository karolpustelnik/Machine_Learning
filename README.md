# Machine Learninig Projects


Here you can find the projects that I have done so far. All of them are in Pytorch. 


#### Project 1 [Data Noise]

In this task, I verified the impact of the data noise level in neural network training.
I will use MLP architecture trained on the MNIST dataset.

#### Project 2 [Computer Vision - Object detection on MNIST]

In this task, I solved an object detection training and prediction task using the anchor-based approach. I implemented architecture from RetinaNet.

#### Project 3 [NLP - LSTM sentiment tagger]

In this task, I implemented LSTM Sentiment Tagger for the imdb reviews dataset.

#### Project 4 [Solutions to Stanford NLP course CS24N]


#### Project 5 [Active Learning]

In this project, I implement diffrent strategies for batch selection that leads to the best increase in model performance.


#### Project 4 [Simulation in Pybullet]

In this simple simulation, I add four cubes in random places within the reach of the robot. I wrote an algorithm to get all the cubes close to the (x=0, y=0, z=-0.1) point.

#### Project 5 [Simulation in Pybullet - working with colours]
In this project I: 
- wrote a program that estimates how long (number of simulation steps) the car should drive forward to be near the target (red ball).
- wrote a program that finds the ball and drive close to it without moving it. The ball is placed randomly in [-3, -3] x [3,3] square, but not too close to [0, 0, 0] (more then 1 m away).
- wrote a program that moves Ball through gate. Ball is located randomly in [1, -1] x [2, 1] rectangle. Car starts in the [0, 0] point. Gate consists of two large blue cylinders in [-2, -1], and [-2, 1] points.

#### Project 5 [Programming Robot in Reality]

In this project I programmed a car to do specific tasks such as:
- recognizing ARUCO markers and driving close to them in a specific way,
- picking specific baskets based on colour and moving them to specific location.

I used a real car that I was able to control through wifi.
